This award has been created to memorialize the unequalled contributions of Dr. McClintock through providing recognition to the most outstanding plant geneticists of the present era. In memory of the many contributions of Dr. McClintock, this Prize will be awarded each year to one or more of the most creative minds and productive scientists in the study of plant genome structure, function and evolution, including the analysis of gene regulation and epigenetics.

## **NSF-funded support for maize genetics:**

The National Science Foundation is supporting the 66th-68th Annual Maize Genetics

Meetings with a grant awarded on November 14th, 2023 (IOS-2329928). This conference

grant will support, Enhancing Institutional Access (EIA), and Disciplinary Breadth (DB) award programs. These programs broaden the participation of researchers with an interest in exploring research possibilities in maize genetics by providing funding to attend the meeting. These travel participants are paired with a team of mentors that included an early career scientist, an academic PI, and an industry or government scientist that engage with the awardees formally and informally before, during, and after the meeting.  Throughout the meeting participants receive professional development training, and opportunities to engage directly with leaders in the field through organized meals with invited speakers. These experiences are vital catalysts for the careers of aspiring student and postdoc trainees. We appreciate the support from the National Science Foundation for this initiative and are excited about the potential for the grant to substantially advance and transform our community.

## The 2025 Attendance/Travel Awards Program

The maize community offers several attendance and travel awards to encourage attendance at the Annual Maize Genetics Meeting (MGM). There are several programs that provide travel/attendance awards; e.g. increasing Disciplinary Breadth (DB), Expanding Institutional Access (EIA), and a general program to support first time attendees. Here are the awardees for 2025; please congratulate these scientists and welcome them to our famously hospitable conference!

## **Broadening International Participation Awards**

The 2025 Broadening International Participation Award program seeks to promote international attendance for researchers from countries that are historically under-represented at the Maize Meeting. This 2025 award program seeks to enrich the maize community and broaden the opportunities to learn about maize genetics by connecting with scientists in the maize genetics community, exploring potential collaborations, and developing career contacts. BIP awardees receive waived registration to the recorded talks and sessions.
