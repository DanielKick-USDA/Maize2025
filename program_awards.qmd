## **The Barbara McClintock Prize for Plant Genetics and Genome Studies**

![https://maizegdb.org/images/medal_front.png](./data/assets/FromTheMGCBoard/clip_image022.gif){alt="https://maizegdb.org/images/medal_front.png"}This award has been created to memorialize the unequalled contributions of Dr. McClintock through providing recognition to the most outstanding plant geneticists of the present era. In memory of the many contributions of Dr. McClintock, this Prize will be awarded each year to one or more of the most creative minds and productive scientists in the study of plant genome structure, function and evolution, including the analysis of gene regulation and epigenetics.

![](./data/assets/FromTheMGCBoard/clip_image024.jpg)The **2024** Barbara McClintock Prize for Plant Genetics and Genome Studies has been awarded to Dr. Caroline Dean who will present a McClintock Prize Address on Friday, March 1, 11:40am CST (See Page 28).

## **NSF-funded Research Coordination Network for maize genetics:**

The National Science Foundation is supporting a 5-year Research Coordination Network project titled “Broadening and Energizing the Maize Research Community”. The project began in January, 2018, and is coordinated by the Maize Genetics Advocacy Committee. The grant funds activities at the Maize Genetics Meeting including the MaGNET program and travel awards to increase disciplinary breadth and underrepresented participation. In addition, the funding allows the Maize Genetics Meeting to systematically enrich the program during the term of the grant. Mid-year conferences are planned yearly to focus on specific topics that are important to the community. The first mid-year conference was held in Madison, WI in September 2018 and included an overall visioning session as well as focus on Functional Genomics Tools and Resources. The second mid-year conference was held in Madison, WI in September 2019 and focused on Data Collection and Curation, Databases, and Genome Annotation. The third mid-year virtual conference was held in October 2020 and focused on public-private partnerships and career development. The fourth mid-year virtual conference was held in January 2022 and focused on strategies for a healthy and inclusive research community. White papers summarizing conclusions of the mid-year conferences are available on MaizeGDB (<https://www.maizegdb.org/mgc/advocacy/docs.php>). Teams have been assembled within the RCN to focus on: Functional Genomics Tools and Resources; Informatics Tools, Resources, and Services; Training and Student Recruitment; Developing Country Interface and Community Breadth; Industry Interface; and diversity, equity, and inclusion within the maize community. We appreciate the support from the National Science Foundation for this initiative and are excited about the potential for the grant to substantially advance and transform our community.

## **The MaGNET Program and 2024 Awards**

**MaGNET (Maize Genetics Network Enhancement via Travel) is a program** that seeks to recruit and retain scientists from diverse backgrounds into the maize research community by encouraging their attendance at the Annual Maize Genetics Meeting (MGM). As such, it provides a source of support to help students and early career scientists from under-represented groups learn about maize genetics and connect with scientists already in the community. Awardees are not required to have previous maize genetics research experience, but will hopefully develop an appreciation of the current excitement in the field, and become an integral part of the community in the future. The program also provides an opportunity for awardees to explore potential collaborations and develop career contacts, and to meet with plenary speakers.

Each MaGNET Award helps defray the cost of attending the Maize Genetics Meeting, including registration, and for in person-meetings- food, lodging and airfare. In addition, each awardee is paired with an experienced ‘Maize Mentor’, who will help the awardee navigate the conference. Awardees are identifiable by a special notation on their name tags, and many of them are attending the MGM for the first time – please congratulate these scientists and welcome them to our famously hospitable conference!

All applicants must show strong potential for a career in the biological sciences, be either citizens or permanent residents of the USA; or employed at a US-based institution, and belong to a group traditionally underrepresented in science. To help provide a more integrative and effective experience at the conference for student awardees, faculty mentors who accompany one or more eligible student applicants are also eligible to apply for a MaGNET award.

## **Expanding Institutional Access and Disciplinary Breadth Awards**

**Expanding Institutional Access (EIA) and Disciplinary Breadth (DB) are two financial aid programs** that seek to recruit and retain scientists from diverse institutions and plant-related disciplines into the maize research community by encouraging their attendance at the Annual Maize Genetics Meeting (MGM). The EIA program seeks to welcome scientists from diverse institutions including community colleges, PUIs, and masters granting institutions into the maize community by encouraging their attendance at the MGM. The Disciplinary Breadth (DB) program seeks to recruit and retain scientists (advanced graduate students, post-docs, and early-career faculty) from plant-related disciplines into the maize research community. The DB program has recently been expanded to support attendance at the meeting for graduate students and postdocs from historically underrepresented groups, regardless of discipline. Both programs provide an opportunity for researchers from diverse disciplines that have potential to enrich the maize community to learn about maize genetics by connecting with scientists in the maize genetics community, exploring potential collaborations, and developing career contacts.

Each award helps defray the cost of attending the Maize Genetics Meeting, including registration, and for in person-meetings- food, lodging and airfare. Awardees are identifiable by a special notation in their badges, and many of them are attending the MGM for the first time – please congratulate these scientists and welcome them to our famously hospitable conference!

All applicants must show strong potential for a career in the biological sciences, and be either citizens or permanent residents of the USA; or employed at a US-based institution. To help provide a more integrative and effective experience at the Meeting for student awardees, faculty who accompany one or more eligible student applicants are also eligible to apply for a EIA or DB award.

## **Broadening International Participation Awards**

The 2024 Broadening International Participation Award program seeks to promote international attendance for researchers from countries that are historically under-represented at the Maize Meeting. This award program seeks to enrich the maize community and broaden the opportunities to learn about maize genetics by connecting with scientists in the maize genetics community, exploring potential collaborations, and developing career contacts. BIP awardees receive waived registration to the recorded talks and sessions.
