## **Health and Safety Policy**

The Maize Genetics Cooperation (MGC) is committed to the health and safety of all Cooperation members and attendees of the Annual Maize Genetics Meeting (MGM). In keeping with the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, we have developed the following health & safety policy for the 2024 Maize Genetics Meeting.

All attendees of the MGM in-person meeting are encouraged to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and up to date on their flu shots before attending the conference.

You **may NOT** attend the conference if you:

-   Are currently required to be in isolation for COVID-19.

-   Are sick and suspect that you have COVID-19 or the flu.

-   Have had a fever within the past 24 hours.

Upon picking up your badge at the in-person conference, we will ask you to certify that you have met the above requirements. If we find that you have knowingly falsified this information, you will forfeit your membership to the Maize Genetics Cooperation and be expelled from the meeting with no refunds.

Masks are encouraged when in common spaces but not required. Attendees wearing masks are encouraged to wear the most protective mask possible such as N95, KN95, or at a minimum surgical masks, while at the MGM to limit the spread of disease.

If you develop COVID-19 symptoms at the Maize Meeting, please stay in your hotel room, and follow CDC guidance, and if you need assistance, please contact the hotel front desk or Tricia Simmons at 720-250-7033.

The MGC has approved these enhanced health and safety measures to protect you, other attendees, and hotel and conference staff. All attendees must abide by these guidelines and follow instructions posted on-site. The MGC assumes no responsibility for liability or financial hardship that may arise during or as a result of your attendance at the meeting. This includes but is not limited to, liability arising from illness, injury, or death associated with infection of COVID-19, flu, communicable disease or complications, symptoms or other effects resulting from contracting COVID-19, the flu, or other communicable diseases.

## **Hospitality**

After the evening sessions on Thursday and Friday there will be informal socializing and poster gazing in Ballrooms B&C, with refreshments, games, and open bar provided from 9 PM - 12 AM. On Saturday evening there will be informal socializing in the Ballrooms B&C, with refreshments and cash bar from 9 PM - Midnight, trivia from 10 PM - 12 AM.\
\
\## **Access to recorded sessions**

All talks and sessions will be recorded and available to each meeting registrant. Registrants will receive an invitation email to view the recordings within 1-2 weeks after the meeting concludes from the Maize Genetics Cooperation (noreply-maize\@iastate.edu). If you do not receive the email by March 31st, please check your junk/spam folder. If you still haven’t received it, or you are having issues with the site where the videos are hosted, please email john.portwood\@usda.gov.

# **FAIR Data Management**

![](data/assets/002_AgBioData.png){fig-align="left"}

![](data/assets/002_MaizeGDB.png)

## *…A Reminder from the MaizeGDB team*

MaizeGDB is a founding member of the AgBioData Consortium. AgBioData is a consortium of agricultural biological databases with the mission of consolidating standards and best practices for acquiring, displaying, and reusing genomic, genetic, and breeding (GGB) data.

Member databases of the AgBioData consortium follow the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles, enhancing the accessibility and reusability of large-scale agricultural research data. MaizeGDB consolidates vast amounts of published data, simplifying discovery and utilization for our community. Your commitment to FAIR principles (go-fair.org) enables MaizeGDB and similar platforms to integrate and leverage even more data efficiently. Below are essential guidelines for applying FAIR data management practices to your generated data, as well as to the data you encounter in research papers and grant reviews.

-   **Database Selection and Accession Reporting:** Ensure your data, such as DNA/RNA/Protein Sequences, genome assemblies, and annotations, are submitted to long-term repositories like NCBI. Always include accession numbers in your publication. For maize SNPs, submit them to EVA at EBI. Explore more repositories at maizegdb.org/FAIRpractices and consult journal guidelines for additional instructions.

-   **Data Publication:** Publish your data concurrently with your paper. For datasets not included with the article, secure a persistent identifier (e.g., DOI) from the data repository to reference in your paper. Datasets can be independently published in journals like Micropublication, ensuring they are linked to the corresponding paper. Verify the presence and FAIR compliance of reported data during peer review.

-   **Gene and Protein Identifier Usage:** Use established identifiers for genes, gene models, and genomes. Avoid renaming existing genes. Look up gene symbols at MaizeGDB and use precise gene model IDs. For protein data, reference the correct ID from NCBI or UniProt, submitting new sequences to these repositories as necessary. Maize nomenclature guidelines: <https://www.maizegdb.org/nomenclature>

-   **Metadata and File Format Standards:** Attach comprehensive metadata to your datasets and adhere to accepted file formats. Treat metadata with the same rigor as experimental and analysis work. Incomplete or poorly described datasets compromise reusability, reproducibility, and overall research quality.

-   **Machine-Readable Data Sets:** Ensure your data is machine-readable, using permanent identifiers and correct terminology (e.g., using correct case for genetic loci, incorporating GO, PO, PATO terms). Validate your data against common, established machine-readable formats.

-   **Data Management Planning:** Allocate sufficient time for meticulous data management, similar to the effort dedicated to other research aspects.

-   **FAIR Data Standards:** Here are some resources:[https://www.go-fair.org](https://www.go-fair.org/),<https://doi.org/10.1093/database/bay088>.

**We are always happy to answer your questions on these issues!** <https://www.maizegdb.org/contact>

**MaizeGDB has partnered with** ***microPublication Biology!***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***microPublication Biology*** **(Caltech Publishers) is a new peer-reviewed, open-access journal that publishes single experiment results, which are incorporated directly into community knowledgebases like MaizeGDB**!

*microPublication Biology* gets your individual research findings, that might otherwise remain unpublished, out to the scientific community while providing credit to those who did the work. Articles are small (one figure, few pages), peer-reviewed, assigned a DOI and are discoverable on [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [EuropePMC](http://europepmc.org/), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/).

How it works: Each maize *microPublication Biology* submission will be vetted by MaizeGDB curators at the time of peer review to ensure data meets FAIR data standards. Upon acceptance, your article is curated into MaizeGDB which couples the publication with curation and discoverability in MaizeGDB. The cost to publish is only \$250.
